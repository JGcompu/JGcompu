Hi there! I am Jiaxuan Guo, a fourth-year student majoring in Physics at Fudan University in China. My research interests are focused on theoretical and computational physics, especially by means of **first-principles calculations** and **machine learning**.

Specifically, I am interested in:
+ *Ab Initio* Methods for Electronic and Optical Properties of Real Materials
+ Twisted 2D Bilayer Materials
+ Artificial Intelligence for Science (Physics, Material Science)
