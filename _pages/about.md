Hi there! I am Jiaxuan Guo, a fourth-year student majoring in Physics at Fudan University in China. My research interests lie in computational physics and materials science, especially by means of **first-principles calculations** and **machine learning**.  

Under the guidance of **Prof. Jing Wang** at **Fudan University**, I conducted research on the utilization of deep learning techniques for the discovery of topological and superconducting materials. Additionally, I worked under the supervision of **Prof. Diana Qiu** at **Yale University**, where I employed first-principles calculations to investigate the behavior of excitons in 2D moiré heterostructures.

I am applying for **2024 fall** Ph.D. in physics and materials science!


### **Research Topics**

### **Experience**
(Details seen in [CV](https://jgcompu.github.io/assets/pdf/finalCV.pdf))

**First-Principles Study of Time-Resolved ARPES on t-MoSe2/WS2 Bilayer**  
Supervised by **Prof. Diana Qiu**  
May 2023 –  Present **Yale University**  
**Part I**: Density Functional Theory (DFT) Level Study
+ Utilized Quantum ESPRESSO to perform Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, investigating band structures and projected Density of States (DOS) for the 60 degrees MoSe2/WS2 heterostructure.
+ Calculated matrix elements in ARPES via the free electron final state approximation.
+ Discovered the interference of wavefunction originating from the upper and lower layers of the heterostructure.

**Part II**: Exciton Level Study
+ Utilized BerkeleyGW package to conduct one-shot G0W0 calculation based on DFT ground state for MoSe2/WS2 heterostructure.
+Employed Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) approach to characterize excitonic properties (e.g. exciton binding energy and exciton wavefunction)
+ Visualized the distribution of excitons within momentum space and calculate the band-to-band transition matrix term.
+ Conducted simulations of PE intensity in tr-ARPES experiments from the exciton level and put forward an explanation for the varying PE intensities observed in t-MoSe2/WS2 at different temperatures.

**Deep Learning Approach to Novel Topological Materials**  
Supervised by **Prof. Jing Wang**  
Dec. 2022 – Apr. 2023 **Fudan University**  
+ Learned some machine learning (ML) methods, including Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), HDBSCAN, and t-SNE.
+ Applied CNN algorithms to streamline the exploration of materials exhibiting notably clean Fermi surfaces, achieving an accuracy rate exceeding 90%.
+ Identified approximately 150 prospective material candidates from a pool of 2,000 entries within the 2Dmatpedia database, significantly accelerating the process of seeking novel topological materials.
