Hi there! I am Jiaxuan Guo, a fourth-year student majoring in Physics at Fudan University in China. My research interests lie in computational physics and materials science, especially by means of **first-principles calculations** and **machine learning**.

### **Research Topics**
+ *Ab Initio* Methods for Electronic and Optical Properties of Real Materials
+ Twisted 2D Bilayer Materials
+ Artificial Intelligence for Science (Physics, Material Science)

### **Experience**
**First-Principles Study of Time-Resolved ARPES on t-MoSe2/WS2 Bilayer**  
Supervised by **Prof. Diana Qiu**  
May 2023 â€“  Present **Yale University**  
**Part I**: Density Functional Theory (DFT) Level Study
+ Utilized Quantum ESPRESSO to perform Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, investigating electronic band structures and k-resolved orbital projected Density of States (DOS) for the MoSe2/WS2 heterostructure with a twist angle of 60 degrees.
+ Formulated and implemented post-processing scripts to calculate matrix elements in ARPES via the free electron final state approximation, thereby describing the intensity distribution in ARPES experiments.
+ Discovered the interference of wavefunction originating from the upper and lower layers of the heterostructure, thus establishing a theoretical explanation for the oscillation of photoemission (PE) intensity as a function of photon energy.

**Part II**: Exciton Level Study
+ Utilized BerkeleyGW package to conduct one-shot G0W0 calculation based on DFT ground state for MoSe2/WS2 heterostructure. Employed Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) approach to characterize excitonic properties (e.g. exciton binding energy and exciton wavefunction)
+ Developed custom scripts to visualize the distribution of excitons within momentum space and calculate the band-to-band transition matrix term, revealing the combined influence of these factors on both the quantity and positioning of intensity peaks observed in experimental results.
+ Conducted simulations of PE intensity in tr-ARPES experiments from the exciton level and put forward an explanation for the varying PE intensities observed in t-MoSe2/WS2 at different temperatures.
