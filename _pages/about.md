Hi there! I am Jiaxuan Guo, a fourth-year student majoring in Physics at Fudan University in China. My research interests lie in computational physics and materials science, especially by means of **first-principles calculations** and **machine learning**.  

I've had the privilege of conducting research under the guidance of **Prof. Jing Wang** at Fudan University, focusing on the application of deep learning in the search for topological and superconducting materials. Additionally, I am also honored to have worked as a visiting student researcher at Yale University, under the supervision of **Prof. Diana Qiu**, where I utilized first-principles calculations to investigate the behavior of excitons in 2D moiré heterostructures.

### **Research Topics**
+ *Ab Initio* Methods for Electronic and Optical Properties of Real Materials
+ Twisted 2D Bilayer Materials
+ Artificial Intelligence for Science (Physics, Material Science)

### **Experience**
**First-Principles Study of Time-Resolved ARPES on t-MoSe2/WS2 Bilayer**  
Supervised by **Prof. Diana Qiu**  
May 2023 –  Present **Yale University**  
**Part I**: Density Functional Theory (DFT) Level Study
+ Utilized Quantum ESPRESSO to perform Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, investigating electronic band structures and k-resolved orbital projected Density of States (DOS) for the MoSe2/WS2 heterostructure with a twist angle of 60 degrees.
+ Formulated and implemented post-processing scripts to calculate matrix elements in ARPES via the free electron final state approximation, thereby describing the intensity distribution in ARPES experiments.
+ Discovered the interference of wavefunction originating from the upper and lower layers of the heterostructure, thus establishing a theoretical explanation for the oscillation of photoemission (PE) intensity as a function of photon energy.

**Part II**: Exciton Level Study
+ Utilized BerkeleyGW package to conduct one-shot G0W0 calculation based on DFT ground state for MoSe2/WS2 heterostructure. Employed Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) approach to characterize excitonic properties (e.g. exciton binding energy and exciton wavefunction)
+ Developed custom scripts to visualize the distribution of excitons within momentum space and calculate the band-to-band transition matrix term, revealing the combined influence of these factors on both the quantity and positioning of intensity peaks observed in experimental results.
+ Conducted simulations of PE intensity in tr-ARPES experiments from the exciton level and put forward an explanation for the varying PE intensities observed in t-MoSe2/WS2 at different temperatures.

**Deep Learning Approach to Novel Topological Materials**  
Supervised by **Prof. Jing Wang**  
May 2023 –  Present **Fudan University**  
+ Learned some machine learning (ML) methods, including Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), HDBSCAN, and t-SNE.
+ Applied CNN algorithms to streamline the exploration of materials exhibiting notably clean Fermi surfaces, achieving an accuracy rate exceeding 90%.
+ Identified approximately 150 prospective material candidates from a pool of 2,000 entries within the 2Dmatpedia database, significantly accelerating the process of seeking novel topological materials.
